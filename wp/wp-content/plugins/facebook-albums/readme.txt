Put your Facebook page albums on your WordPress.

== Description ==

Facebook Album allows you to display your Facebook photos right onto your WordPress site. Simply copy an album's URL and use the plugin's shortcode - or widget - to display that album. By default the plugin works seamlessly with Facebook Page albums, however to use your personal Facebook albums you must configure a Facebook app. If you need help, [check out this YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p_OZ7qbxk4).

Through Settings -> Facebook Album you can adjust the thumbnail sizes of your album's photos when they are displayed, along with enabling or disabling the album's title or the photo's description display.

This plugin comes bundled with Colorbox, which can be disabled. Certain colorbox options are configurable, more will be soon.


= Shortcode Example: =
[fbalbum url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.376995711728.190761.20531316728]

[fbalbum url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.376995711728.190761.20531316728 limit=10]

== Installation ==

Upload the Facebook Album plugin to your WordPress plugin folder, and then just activate it! Use the shortcode in posts and pages.

 == Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Plugin says Facebook API came back with result, but no photos =
This is an authentication issue. If you are not using a Facebook app, try setting one up to see if that resolves the issue. Only Facebook Page photo albums can be used without a Facebook app.

= My album is never found? =
The plugin "looks" for the album ID in the URL, if the URL is wrong, the plugin cannot find an album to display

= Can I change the thumbnails displayed from the shortcode? =
Yes, find Facebook Albums under the Settings area of your dashboard.

= How do I use Facebook Albums =
Simply use the [fbalbum url=] shortcode. Not sure how it will look? Copy the example in the description.

= I want different thumb sizes for my pictures =
By defauly Facebook stores images in 9 sizes, one being original, and two a pretty similar in miniture thumbnails. I incorporated the basic thumbnails to try and keep the Facebook appeal to the plugin.
